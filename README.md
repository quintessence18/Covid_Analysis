# Covid_Analysis

## Background
This notebook looks into analysing Covid data by following this kaggle notebook: https://www.kaggle.com/therealcyberlord/coronavirus-covid-19-visualization-prediction

I have used this notebook to work on my analysis and modelling skills - certain fields have been changed to take a look at UK numbers and predictions

## Dataset 
All data can be found from this kaggle submission: https://www.kaggle.com/imdevskp/corona-virus-report
